## ðŸ¦‰ Main information

Pretty simple Css/Js scroll animation.

The project goal:
- when the user starts scrolling, the sections of the site start to come in from the left and from the right
- use CSS transitions to have it come in smoothly
- use JavaScript to tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come in and add a specific class to show it
- set up in HTML, style it with CSS and add the functionality with JavaScript
